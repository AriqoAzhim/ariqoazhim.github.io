NOTES ON COMPONENT TESTING -> shallow testing attempted but could not get to work
WELCOME Component:
    TEST 1: is a basic rendering test to ensure that the img logo and two navigating buttons are present
    TEST 2: Since we can observe ourself if the render is working or not, we check for features that we can't see
            so test button admin correctly routes to './login' on click
    TEST 3: Same as test 2 but instead checks if the play button correctly routes to './play'
