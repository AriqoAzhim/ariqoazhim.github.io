Structs allow you to group related data together.

# Example Implementation:

```rust
// struct used to define a User 
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count:  u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    // can't just make one field mutable, you have to make it all mutable
    let mut user1 = User{
        email: String::from("ariqo.azhim@gmail.com"),
        username: String::from("ricky"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1
    }

    // you can access struct values using .
    let name = user1.username;
    // you can overwrite struct values if you make it mutable
    user1.username = String::from("wallace123");

    // abstract user creation to a function
    let user2 = build_user(String::from("JohnDoe@gmail.com"), String::from("johnHoee");

    //  fill missing gaps using ..<struct instantiation>
    let user3 = User {
        email: String::from("james@gmail.com"),
        username: String::from("james"),

        // this populates this struct's remaining fields with
        // whatever is in user2
        ..user2
    }
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        // because the fields and the arguments have the same syntax we just say email and username
        // field init shorthand syntax
        email
        username
        sign_in_count: 0,
        active: true
    }
}
```

# Structs without name fields

```rust
    // You can also create structs without name fields aka tuple structs
    //e.g
    // These are useful when you want to have tuples of the same type but with different names
    // as shown here Color and Point have the same internals but have different names
    struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

    struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
```

# Printing a struct

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // This is required by rust if you want to print the struct
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32
}

fn main() {
    // define rect variable with 30, 50
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50
    }
    // {:#?} is used when trying to print a struct variable, otherwise it is normally {}
    println!("rect: {:#?}", rect);

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels",
        area(&rect)
    );
}
```

This will print out:

# Creating Struct Methods

You need to create an implementation block which will house all of the structâ€™s functions and methods. Methods make the code for organised and makes it clear to the user which functions/methods are associated to what struct/data

```rust
// for the above Rectangle struct
impl Rectangle {
    // the first argument in a method is always self, which is a reference to the 
    // instance of the struct calling the method
    // you can also take ownership of the instance or make it mutable but in this case we just use
    // a reference to it (&self)
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
// example with 2 arguments
fn can_hold(&self, other: Rectangle) -> bool {
	self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
}
```

We can also define associated functions in our implementation block. These would be functions that are associated with the struct but do not need a struct to be a reference. Additionally, these functions can be created within another implementation block for clarity as RUST allows a struct to have multiple implementation blocks

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    // Associated function that creates a Rectangle of equal with and height
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: size,
            height: size
        }
    }
    
}
```
