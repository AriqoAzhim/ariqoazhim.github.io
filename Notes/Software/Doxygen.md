Doxygen allows you to automatically generate documentation for a code base by following a certain commenting style

- DONT USE doxypypy (python lib for easier comment formatting) as of 13/12/2022 (was broken, could be better now)
- use Awesome Doxygen to add StyleSheet for customisation of output

```jsx

```

Use doxywizard to generate doxygen documentation
